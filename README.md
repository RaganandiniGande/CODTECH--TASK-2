Overview of the Project 

Project:GENERATIVIE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (GANS)

Objective:
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) aim to create new, realistic data that looks like real examples. They have two parts:

1. **Generator**: Creates new data, like fake images or text.
2. **Discriminator**: Checks if the data is real or fake.

The generator tries to make better and more realistic data, while the discriminator gets better at spotting fakes. This competition helps both parts improve, leading to high-quality, realistic results.

Key activities For Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) :
1. **Data Preparation**: Collect and preprocess the dataset that the GAN will learn from.
2. **Model Architecture Design**: Define the structure of the generator and discriminator networks.
3. **Training**: Iteratively train the generator and discriminator in a competitive manner.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the quality of the generated outputs compared to real data.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust model parameters to improve performance.
6. **Testing**: Validate the modelâ€™s effectiveness on new or unseen data.

Technoloies used:
